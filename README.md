# Dijkstra-Algorithm-for-Shortest-Path-using-C-
This C project employs Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two gouvernorats in a Tunisia. The project utilizes a linked list as the primary data structure for efficient graph representation.

1/Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation: The project includes a robust implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, a widely-used algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph.
2/Gouvernorats as Vertices: Gouvernorats are represented as nodes in the graph, forming a network of interconnected nodes.
3/Linked List as Data Structure: A linked list is employed to manage the adjacency list, providing an efficient way to represent and traverse the graph.
4/Dynamic Memory Allocation: The project dynamically allocates memory for nodes, ensuring scalability and efficient memory usage.
